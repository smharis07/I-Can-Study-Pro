# I-Can-Study-Pro
Hello there, busy bee! (˶> ⤙ <˶)
Welcome to your new study hive. My name is Honey Bun, and I'll be your personal guide on this
journey. Think of this app not just as a place to take notes, but as a smart partner that helps you
understand *how* you learn best.

### What is .ᐟ Can Stひdy Pro?
It’s a powerful tool designed to help you organize your studies, track your understanding of
different topics, and see your knowledge grow. You can structure your learning, identify your
weak spots, and even visualize how different ideas connect.

### Getting Started: Your First Subject
When you first open the app, you'll see a friendly welcome screen. The best way to start is by
creating your first subject.
1. Click the big **"Create Your First Subject"** button.
2. A new "Subject Card" will appear. Simply click on the title ("New Subject") and type in the
name of your class, like "Biology" or "Art".
3. That's it! You've planted your first seed.

### The Main Workspace: Building Your Hive
Your workspace is built on a simple three-level structure:
* **Subjects:** The main category (e.g., Math).
* **Chapters:** Sections within a subject (e.g., Algebra).
* **Topics:** The specific things you're studying (e.g., Quadratic Equation).
You can **add**, **rename**, **delete**, and **reorder** any of these cards using the buttons on
each card header and the little grip handle to drag and drop.
Click the little arrow on any card to expand it and see what's inside or collapse it to keep your
workspace tidy.
### Mastering a Topic: The Real Magic Happens Here
When you expand a "Topic" card, you'll find the core tools to help you learn.
#### 1. Cookie Analysis (How Do You *Really* Feel?)
This is your self-assessment tool. For each topic, you rate your confidence across four areas.
Be honest! This is how the app learns where you need the most help. Steps: (how to utilize it for
performance).
1. Time spent studying: How much effort have you put in?
2. Answering curveball questions: Can you apply the knowledge in; practice questions or
tricky ways?
3. Confidence recalling facts: Can you remember the facts while practicing?
4. Time spent relearning: How often do you have to go back and review this?
Your selections here calculate the topic's **Score %**.
#### 2. Your Digital Notebook
This is where you write down everything you're learning. It’s more than just a plain text box!
* **Formatting: You can make text **bold**, *italic*, create bulleted or numbered lists, and even
highlight important sentences.
* **Cornell Notes: Click the "Cornell" button to switch to a powerful note-taking layout that
separates main notes, cues/questions, and a summary. It's fantastic for active recall and review.
* **Add Images: Paste images or upload them directly into your notes to make them more
visual.
* **BeeHive Tags: This is a superpower! Type a hashtag (`#`) followed by a keyword (e.g.,
`#photosynthesis`). This creates a special tag that links this topic to any other topic where you
use the same tag, even across different subjects!
---
### The Dashboard
Click the **"Dashboard"** button in the top right to get a complete overview of your progress.
* **Overall Progress: A simple average of all your topic scores.
* **Cookie Analysis: Shows your average score for each "cookie" category. If your "Curveball
questions" score is low, you know what to practice!
* **Current Streak: You earn "Streak Points" for making progress, like improving a topic score
or completing a to-do item. It’s a great motivator to study consistently!
* **What To Do?: A simple to-do list for your study-related tasks.
* **Upcoming Deadlines: Set due dates for subjects or chapters, and they'll appear here so you
never miss one.
* **Honey Bun Journal: I'll give you a new question every day to reflect on your study habits
and feelings. It's a great way to be mindful about your learning process.
* **Weak Topics Analysis: This is your secret weapon! It automatically lists all topics with a
score below 75%. It's your personalized "to-improve" list.
---
#### 🐝 The BeeHive Knowledge Map
In the "Subject Performance" chart on your dashboard, click on a subject's dot. This opens an
incredible visual map of your knowledge!
* **See Connections: The map shows how your topics are linked together by the **#tags** you
created.
* **Discover Insights: You might see a surprising link between a topic in History and one in Art!
This is how you build a deeper, more connected understanding.
* **Navigate Hives: If a topic from another subject is linked, you can double-click it to fly over to
that subject's hive!
#### Focus Sessions
In the "Weak Topics" card on the dashboard, you'll see a **"Start Focus Session"** button. This
is for serious, distraction-free studying.
1. **Choose Your Topics: Select 2-4 weak topics you want to improve.
2. **Set a Timer: Decide how long you want to study.
3. **Enter the Zone: The app will take you to a full-screen overlay. It will guide you through a
"Review" phase and a "Practice" phase for each topic, showing you your notes and keeping you
on track with a timer.

### Keeping Your Data Safe
Your data is stored locally in your browser. To protect it, use these tools:
* **Backup: This downloads a JSON file of all your data to your computer. Do this regularly!
* **Restore (Replace): This will **completely delete** your current data and replace it with the
data from a backup file.
* **Restore (Merge): This intelligently combines a backup file with your current data, adding
new things without deleting what you already have. This is useful if you use the app on two
different computers.
### ⚠️ Words of Caution: Handle With Care!
To make sure everything runs smoothly, please keep these things in mind:
1. This App is Local: All your hard work is saved in **your web browser's storage** on this
specific computer. It's not in the cloud.
CRITICAL: If you "Clear Browsing Data" or "Clear Site Data" for your browser, **you will
lose everything.
2. Backup is Your Best Friend: Please, please, *please* use the **Backup** button regularly!
Save the file somewhere safe like Google Drive or Device Storage. If your computer crashes,
this backup file is the only way to get your data back.
3. Know Your Restore Options: Understand the difference between **Restore (Replace)** and
**Restore (Merge)**. Accidentally using "Replace" when you meant to "Merge" can cause you to
lose recent work.
4. Be Honest with the Cookies: The "Weak Topics" and "Focus Session" features are only as
good as your self-assessment. Be honest about your confidence levels to get the most accurate
guidance.

That's it! You're ready to start building your hive of knowledge. I'm so excited to see how much
you'll grow. Don't be afraid to explore, click around, and make it your own.
